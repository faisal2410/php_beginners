<?php
/*
The for(;;){} loop is a special case of the for loop, where all three sections are omitted. This creates an infinite loop that will repeat forever, unless a break statement is used to exit the loop.

    In practice, infinite loops are often used when you need to keep running a certain block of code until a certain condition is met. For example, you might use an infinite loop to keep checking for user input until the user enters a valid value. To avoid an infinite loop from running forever and crashing your program, you should always include a break statement or some other means of exiting the loop when a certain condition is met.
