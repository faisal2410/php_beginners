<?php
// In PHP, $_SERVER is a superglobal variable that contains information about the server and the execution environment in which the current PHP script is running. It is an associative array that provides a wide range of information about the current request, including HTTP headers, request method, and client IP address.

// Here is an example that demonstrates how to use $_SERVER to access the client IP address:


$client_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
echo $client_ip;

// In the above example, we access the REMOTE_ADDR key in the $_SERVER array to retrieve the IP address of the client that made the current request.

// Real-life use cases for $_SERVER include:

// Request information: $_SERVER can be used to retrieve information about the current request, such as the request method, request URI, and HTTP headers. For example:

$request_method = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];
$request_uri = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
$user_agent = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];

// Server information: $_SERVER can be used to retrieve information about the server that is running the current PHP script, such as the server name, server software, and server port. For example:

$server_name = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
$server_software = $_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE'];
$server_port = $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'];

// Environment variables: $_SERVER can be used to access environment variables that are set on the server where the PHP script is running. For example, you can use $_SERVER['PATH'] to retrieve the system path where executable files are located.

// Security-related information: $_SERVER can be used to retrieve security-related information, such as the client IP address, client user agent, and HTTPS status. For example:


$client_ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
$client_user_agent = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
$is_https = (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] == 'on');

// Retrieving the current script filename
// The $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] variable contains the name of the current script file, relative to the server root. Here is an example that demonstrates how to use $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] to retrieve the current script filename:


$current_script = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];
echo $current_script;

// Retrieving the server protocol
// The $_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL'] variable contains the name and version of the protocol that the server is using. Here is an example that demonstrates how to use $_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL'] to retrieve the server protocol:


$server_protocol = $_SERVER['SERVER_PROTOCOL'];
echo $server_protocol;

// Retrieving the client user agent
// The $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] variable contains the user agent string that is sent by the client. Here is an example that demonstrates how to use $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] to retrieve the client user agent:


$client_user_agent = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
echo $client_user_agent;

// Retrieving the request method
// The $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] variable contains the request method used to access the current script, such as GET, POST, or PUT. Here is an example that demonstrates how to use $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] to retrieve the request method:


$request_method = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];
echo $request_method;

// Retrieving the server IP address
// The $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] variable contains the IP address of the server that is running the current script. Here is an example that demonstrates how to use $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'] to retrieve the server IP address:


$server_ip_address = $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'];
echo $server_ip_address;

// In summary, $_SERVER is a powerful tool for retrieving information about the server and the execution environment in which a PHP script is running. It can be used to retrieve information about the current request, server information, environment variables, and security-related information, among other things.





// In summary, $_SERVER is a superglobal variable in PHP that provides a wide range of information about the server and the execution environment in which the current PHP script is running. It can be used to retrieve request information, server information, environment variables, and security-related information.
